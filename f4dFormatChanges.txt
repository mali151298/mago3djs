0) Save version (char) for References, Models, Octrees.

1) Reference transformation matrix type: 
	0 = identity
	1 = translation
	2 = transformation
	
	improves 5~10 % the fps.
	
2) Triangles count for each octree(unsigned int).
	with this information we can forecast automatically the lod level distances, and
	calculate parsing time in queue.
	
			3) Merge in one group the multiples meshes of same Id. ( only javaScript ).

4) Lego for each object ( to use as bounding box for render in lod1 ) Save in Models buffer (n = 0).

5) Save the reference texture indexed (unsigned short) Save in Header the textures map.
	
			6) Possibility to add optional files in the project folder (spatial structure, topological data, etc.).

			7) Lod3.
